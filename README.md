As comparison, the technology category is the one that brings more money, with an average of 2430% more than the original goal. Although these campaigns draw a good amount of money, they carry a very high-risk factor and most of the campaigns end up in failure. Only 38% of the campaigns are successful.
                                                         
Analysing the campaigns in the US that funded theater plays, the average that the plays are funded is $4,000. This fact does not seem encouraging, however from the plays asking for $10,000, *60%* of those were successful and got on average 11% more that the initial goal.

The analysis shows that there is a good tendency that a $10,000 campaign can reach success, however there are factors that the number do not reveal. If the decision is to go forward with the campaign, a proper **marketing** of the campaign and advertising can be a game changer.

Regarding the idea to lauch a musical campaign on the UK, the analysis shows that the average of the campaigns goal is GBP $4,000, however the successful campaigns were able to rise on average GBP $1,050 with a maximum of GBP $3,500.
