From all US Kickstarter campaigns, the analysis shows that the theater category has the greatest number of campaigns on Kickstarter, with almost 1,000. The campaigns get, on average, 25% more than the original goal and have a successful rate of 58%.

The graph 2 â€“ Theater Category Outcomes summarize the above.

As comparison, the technology category is the one that brings more money, with an average of 2430% more than the original goal. Although these campaigns draw a good amount of money, they carry a very high-risk factor and most of the campaigns end up in failure. Only 38% of the campaigns are successful.
                                                         
Analysing the campaigns in the US that funded theater plays, the average that the plays are funded is $4,000. This fact does not seem encouraging, however from the plays asking for $10,000, 60% of those were successful and got on average 11% more that the initial goal.

The analysis shows that there is a good tendency that a $10,000 campaign can reach success, however there are factors that the number do not reveal. If the decision is to go forward with the campaign, a proper marketing of the campaign and advertising can be a game changer.
